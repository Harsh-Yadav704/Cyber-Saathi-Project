              <p>Mar 26, 2024</p>
            </div>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday unsealed indictments against seven Chinese nationals for their involvement in a hacking group that targeted U.S. and foreign critics, journalists, businesses, and political officials for about 14 years.</p>
            <p>The suspected cyber spies have been charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with a state-sponsored threat group tracked as APT31, which is also known as Altaire, Bronze Vinewood, Judgement Panda, and Violet Typhoon (formerly Zirconium). The hacking collective has been active since at least 2010.</p>

              <h2>Crafting Shields: Defending Minecraft Servers Against DDoS Attacks</h2>
              <p>Mar 26, 2024</p>
            </div>
            <p>Minecraft, with over 500 million registered users and 166 million monthly players, faces significant risks from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, threatening server functionality, player experience, and the game's reputation. Despite the prevalence of DDoS attacks on the game, the majority of incidents go unreported, leaving a gap in awareness and protection.</p>
            <p>In a DDoS attack, the attacker's objective is to disrupt a Minecraft server, rendering it unstable or unavailable to legitimate users, by flooding it with malicious traffic until it becomes overwhelmed. DDoS attacks on Minecraft servers can last anywhere from a few seconds to days, depending on their severity and the countermeasures in place.</p>
